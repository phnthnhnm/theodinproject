    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When I was a kid, we often spent all day at the community pool. We’d leisurely snack on popsicles and chips, until it was time for lunch. No one wanted to dry off, get dressed, and go home for
      lunch. Mayonnaise didn’t travel well and wasn’t safe under the summer sun. Peanut butter sandwiches were a solution, but also suffered under the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      My kids love the pool too, so I looked for a better alternative to those less-than lunches of childhood. The answer? Stuffed sandwiches. They travel well and are easy to eat, even with wet pool
      fingers. Prepping the night before or in the morning is easy with a round loaf filled with sandwich fixings. A bake-on mustard and butter coating adds extra flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ingredients are easy; you can make this sandwich from whatever deli meats and cheeses you have on hand. Kid hands can also help in the process. Simply make or buy a round unsliced bread
      loaf, cut off the top, scoop out the insides, and fill. The completed round sandwich stores well in the fridge overnight. Slice it ahead and put it in zip-top bags. Or, keep it in the circular
      form and wrap the entire sandwich for slicing and serving poolside.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 round bread loaf</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
      <li>1/2 pound sliced deli ham</li>
      <li>1/2 pound sliced deli turkey</li>
      <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>6 slices Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like you’re making a soup bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the loaf top.</li>
      <li>Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to break through the sides. The loaf interior can be used to make croutons, so there’s no waste.</li>
      <li>Melt butter with mustard in the microwave for 15 seconds in a small bowl. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Brush butter mixture onto the exterior of the bread loaf and top; place loaf and top on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool.</li>
      <li>
        Pat lettuce dry and place a layer in the bottom of the hollowed-out loaf. Layer cheese over lettuce. Add a layer of ham and turkey. Repeat until the loaf is full. Top with reserved bread top.
      </li>
      <li>Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and put on a baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top with something to weigh it down.</li>
      <li>Place the completed sandwich on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
      <li>Keep the sandwich whole or cut it into easy triangular sections.</li>
    </ol>
